## BCS

Codes in this dir is mostly generated by https://github.com/novifinancial/serde-reflection.
Only a little modification.

```shell
./serdegen --language TypeScript --target-source-dir ./runtime --with-runtimes Bcs Serde ~/projects/starcoinorg/starcoin/etc/starcoin_types.yml
```

If you want to update the codes, remove the old runtime dir, and use the cmd to rewrite.
Then use `git diff` to compare the changes, and cherry pick our modification back to the new generated runtime codes.
