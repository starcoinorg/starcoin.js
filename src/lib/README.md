## BCS

Codes in this dir is mostly generated by https://github.com/novifinancial/serde-reflection.
Only a little modification.

## Type Architecture Diagram

|-js(client level):  lib/runtime/index.ts 
|
|-scs:  lib/runtime/starcoin_types/index.ts
|
|-bcs:  lib/runtime/bcs/index.ts
|
|-serde: lib/runtime/serde/index.ts

## Development
If you want to update the codes:

1. remove the old runtime dir, and use the cmd to rewrite.
```shell
./serdegen --language TypeScript --target-source-dir ./runtime --with-runtimes Bcs Serde ~/projects/starcoinorg/starcoin/etc/starcoin_types.yml
```

2. please use IDEs(like VS Code) to format code of this file `starcoin_types/index.ts` first.

3. Then use `git diff` to compare the changes, and cherry pick our modification back to the new generated runtime codes.
